# fitfForTrain starter (tf-pose-estimation)

pose estimation algorithm, have been implemented using Tensorflow. It also provides several variants that have some changes to the network structure for **real-time processing on the CPU or low-power embedded devices.**

**You can even run this on your macbook with a descent FPS!**

Original Repo(Caffe) : https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose

## Install

### Dependencies

You need dependencies below.

- python3
- tensorflow 1.4.1+
- opencv3, protobuf, python3-tk
- slidingwindow
  - https://github.com/adamrehn/slidingwindow
  - I copied from the above git repo to modify few things.

### Pre-Install Jetson case

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libllvm-7-ocaml-dev libllvm7 llvm-7 llvm-7-dev llvm-7-doc llvm-7-examples llvm-7-runtime
$ export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-7 
```

### Install

Clone the repo and install 3rd-party libraries.

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Build c++ library for post processing.
```
$ cd tf_pose/pafprocess
$ swig -python -c++ pafprocess.i && python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Models & Performances


### Download Tensorflow Graph File(pb file)

Before running demo, you should download graph files. You can deploy this graph on your mobile or other platforms.

- cmu (trained in 656x368)
- mobilenet_thin (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_large (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_small (trained in 432x368)

CMU's model graphs are too large for git, so I uploaded them on an external cloud. You should download them if you want to use cmu's original model. Download scripts are provided in the model folder.

```
$ cd models/graph/cmu
$ bash download.sh
```
## Python Usage


See [run.py](run.py) or [run_webcam.py](run_webcam.py) as references.

```python
e = TfPoseEstimator(get_graph_path(args.model), target_size=(w, h))
humans = e.inference(image)
image = TfPoseEstimator.draw_humans(image, humans, imgcopy=False)
```

If you installed it as a package,

```python
import tf_pose
coco_style = tf_pose.infer(image_path)
```
